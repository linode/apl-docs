When a form (build, workload, service, backup, secret) is submitted, APL will prepare a commit in the APL Values (otomi-values) Git repository. When the commit is prepared, the `Deploy Changes` button in the top of the left menu will become active. To commit your changes, click on the Deploy Changes button.
