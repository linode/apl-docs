All known Network Policies on the platform are listed here. Network Policies can be sorted based on:

| Property      | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name          | The name of the Network Policy                                  |
| Rule type     | Type of the Network Policy (Ingress or Egress)                  |
| Team          | The name of the Team responsible for the build                  |

A platform admin can also create builds. Make sure to select the correct context (team-name) in the top bar. See [here](/docs/for-devs/console/netpols.md) for more information about creating builds.
