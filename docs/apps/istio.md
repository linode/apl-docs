## Introduction

Since Otomi has security best practices built in, it is designed for intrusion.
Istio is installed by Otomi as a service mesh to deliver the following capabilities:

- mTLS enforcement for all traffic that is deemed compromisable
- egress control, forcing teams to choose explicit egress endpoints
- advanced routing capabilities such as weight based load balancing (A/B or blue/green testing)

In the future we might make it possible to opt out of Istio, but that effectively nullifies the mTLS capabilities and egress control.
