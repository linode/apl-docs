A Project is a collection of a Build, a Workload and a Service in ONE self-service form. When a user creates a project, the name of the project will be used for all created resources (a build, a workload and a service).

All known Builds on the platform are listed here. Builds can be sorted based on:

| Property      | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name          | The name of the project                                |
| Team          | The name of the Team responsible for the project       |

Follow the instructions [here](../../for-devs/console/projects.md) to create a Project.
