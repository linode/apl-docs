## Co-Monitoring

:::note

Co-Monitoring settings will only be active when Alertmanager is active.
:::

This section is similar to the [Alerts](alerts.md) section, but with a different intent: the configuration here is meant to target 3rd party alerting endpoints. Those will become active when the Remote monitoring option (in Settings/Otomi) is turned on. When used, the "Alerts" section should only contain endpoints for the 3rd party. Of course teams can still configure their own alert endpoints.
