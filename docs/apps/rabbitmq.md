Kubernetes operator to deploy and manage RabbitMQ clusters.

## Overview

[RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) is a controller and custom resource definition (CRD) designed for the lifecycle (creation, upgrade, graceful shutdown) of a RabbitMQ cluster.

RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.

RabbitMQ can be activated and used in tandem with the `Workload Category` to create a RabbitMQ Cluster with `Queues` and `Policies`.
