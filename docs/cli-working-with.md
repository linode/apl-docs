When you would like to do local development, you will operate on the values directly and have to apply them manually.

## Install Otomi CLI

If you haven't deployed Otomi with the CLI, install the Otomi CLI first. See [here](/docs/cli) to install Otomi CLI.

## Pull the values

Clone the `otomi/values` repository from `gitea.<your.domain>/otomi/values` (if not already done) to work with the values locally.

```bash
git clone https://gitea.<your.domain>/otomi/values.git
cd values
```

:::note ATTENTION: Are you using SOPS? Then do first do the following:

- Make sure you have installed the SOPS extention for VSC.
- Add your `.secrets` file to the `values` folder
- Source the secrets: `source .secrets`
- Decrypt the secrets by running `otomi decrypt`

:::

## Bootstap the values

First create a `.env` file in the `env` folder and add the following line:

```bash
echo 'export K8S_CONTEXT="<the-context-of-your-k8s-cluster>"' > .env
```

Bootstap the local values:

```bash
otomi bootstap
```

## Adding a new team to the values

In the following steps we are going to create a team with the name 'demo':

### 1. Modify the teams.yaml

Add the team to the `values/env/teams.yaml`:

```yaml
teamConfig:
  teams:
    demo:
      id: demo
      oidc:
        groupMapping: <group-object-id> # The id of the AD group with the team members who need access to the team
```

Add the team to the `secrets.teams.yaml` (or `secrets.teams.yaml.dec` when using SOPS):

```yaml
teamConfig:
  teams:
    demo:
      password: somesecretvalue
```

When using SOPS, first encrypt the team password:

```bash
otomi encrypt
```

Add the following 3 files to the `/env/teams` folder:

1. `external-secrets.demo.yaml`
2. `jobs.demo.yaml`
3. `services.demo.yaml`

Each file should contain an empty object:

```yaml
{}
```

## validate changes (optional)

Now validate the new values based on the Otomi values schema:

```bash
otomi validate-values
```

Use `-v` to get more output (or `-vvv` to get even more output). See [here](/docs/cli/validate-values) for a full list of `otomi validate` command options. When successful, the output will show: `otomi:validate-values:verbose Values validation SUCCESSFUL`

## Deploy changes

Deploy the changes using Otomi CLI:

```bash
otomi apply
```

Use `-v` to get more output (or `-vvv` to get even more output). See [here](/docs/cli/apply) for a full list of `otomi apply` command options.

Note: Creating a team can take around 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

## Commit changes

Now commit your changes to the (otomi/values) GIT repository on the cluster to store the new desired state configuration.
