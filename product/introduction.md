Otomi is an open source self-hosted PaaS to run on top of any Kubernetes cluster and is placed in the CNCF landscape under the [PaaS/Container Service](https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#platform--paas-container-service) section. Otomi attempts to connect many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a way to provide direct value. Otomi can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, offering a multi and hybrid platform experience out-of-the-box. No more re-inventing the wheel when building and maintaining your own Kubernetes based (internal developer) platform or bespoke stack.
