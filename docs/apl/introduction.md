## Application Platform for LKE (APL)

Application Platform for LKE (APL) is a platform that combines developer- and operations-centric tools, automation and self-service to streamline the application lifecycle. From development to delivery to management of containerized application workloads.

APL connects many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a way to provide direct value. No more re-inventing the wheel when building and maintaining your own Kubernetes based platform or bespoke stack.

APL is optimized to run on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE), but can also (manually) be installed on any other [conformant Kubernetes cluster](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/).
