## Introduction

Kubeclarity can be activated in Otomi to run on-demand scans of running containers in selected namespaces using one or more scanners running in parallel. Otomi also offers Trivy Operator for runtime scanning. Trivy Operator is configured to scan team namespaces only.
## Configuration

Kubeclarity is by default configured using Trivy as a scanner and analyser. If you like to run multiple scanners in parallel, then select the scanners before activating Kubeclarity. This can not be changed afterwards.
