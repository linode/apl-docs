## Comming soon!

Soon you'll be able to provision a LKE cluster combined with the Application Platform. This will have the following advantages compared to installing the Application Platform manually:

- The Application Platform will be automatically installed for you on LKE

- Each LKE cluster where the Application Platform is installed will automatically be configured to use Akamai Edge DNS (for FREE!)

- If approved by the user, all the required Buckets in Object Storage will be created for you
