## About User Management

What you need to know about the User Management feature:

- Only Platform administrators can create or delete users in the platform view.
- A Platform administrator can assign users the role of `platform administrator`, `team administrator` or `team member`.
- Users can be created without assigning them directly to a Team.
- Team administrators can assign users the role of Team member of the Team they administer.
- Team administrators can not remove themselves from Teams they administer (this can only be done by the platform admin).
- Team administrators can not remove other Team administrators from their teams (this can only be done by the platform admin).
- Team administrators can not add Platform administrators to their Teams.
- Team members are not able to see the User Management section in the menu.
- Users are stored encrypted in the `values` repository.
- The initial login credentials of a new User can be copied from the platform view user management page by Platform administrators only.
- Usersâ€™ passwords are not stored in the values repo (except initial password).
- A password reset can only be performed by a Platform admin. A password reset needs to be done in the Keycloak app using the `otomi-admin` credentials. As an alternative a user with the platform administrator role can also re-create a user.
- Kubernetes secrets are used to pass user data between Pods, but there is a limit for user-defined variables. The maximum size of a user-defined environment variable is 32,767 characters. This limits the amount of users that can be created to around 200.

## Creating Users

1. Select the `Platform` view in the top bar.

2. Click on `User Management` in the left menu.

3. Click on `Create User`.

4. Fill in a unique `email` address and the first and last name of the new user.

5. Add the new user to the required groups:

- Select `Is platform admin` to add the user to the `Platform Administrators` group.
- Select `Is team admin` to add the user to the `Team Administrators` group. When the user becomes a Team admin, optionally also select the Teams the user is going to administer.
- Select a `Team` to add the user to the `team members` group.

6. Click `Submit`.

7. In the list of Users, click on the `copy initial credentials to clipboard` icon.

8. Send the initial credentials to the new user.

The new user will be prompted to change the initial password at first login.

The following example shows how to create a user account and assign the user the `team-admin` role for the Team `Demo`:
