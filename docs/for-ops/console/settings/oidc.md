## OIDC

:::note
OIDC settings will only be active when the `otomi.hasExternalIDP=true` flag is set during installation. This can also be set after installation in Settings/General.
:::

The OIDC settings section offers configuration options to connect with an external Identity Provider (Bring Your Own IDP). This allows to map IDP group names to the following platform roles:

- Platform administrators (`adminGroupID`)

- Team administrators (`teamAdminGroupID`)
