After installing Otomi, a couple of post install configuration actions are required. Follow these instructions:

### Sign in to the Otomi Console

Open the url in the browser of your choice `https://otomi.<domainSuffix>`. The `domainSuffix` can be found in the `values.yaml` that was provided during installation.

If Otomi is configured with OIDC (using Azure AD as an IDP), click on the right button (redkubes-azure in the example below). If you did not configure OIDC, log in with the default `otomi-admin` account and the password provided during installation.

After you have successfully logged in, you will see the **Otomi Dashboard.**. To learn more about using Otomi Console, checkout [Otomi Console](/docs/console)

### Activate Drone

[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) and [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) are an integral part of how Otomi cluster configurations are stored and updated. Click on the **Gitea** app (under Platform/Otomi Apps) in the console. It will open a new browser tab and show the sign in page of Gitea. Sign in into with the default `otomi-admin` account.

After sign in, it can take a couple of minutes before the `otomi/values` repository becomes visible.

The **_otomi/values_** repository holds the otomi cluster configuration and is updated whenever new changes occur through the console. Now head back to the console to activate Drone.

Click on the **Drone** app and it should open a new tab as shown below,

Select `Activate` -> `ACTIVATE REPOSITORY`

Save the changes and you are good to go.

Now the final step is to create a Team. See the **[Teams](/docs/console/teams)** page for more information.
