Cert-Manager is used by Otomi to automatically create and rotate wildcard TLS certificate for service endpoints. You may bring your own CA, or let Otomi create one for you. If you bring your own trusted wildcard certificate, then cert-manager will not manage this certificate.

:::info
The wildcard certificate must be valid for the following domain `*.<cluster.domainSuffix>`, where the value of `<cluster.domainSuffix>` comes from the cluster.yaml file.
:::

:::info
Setting CertManager to use Letsencrypt requires DNS availability of the requesting domains, and forces Otomi to install [ExternalDNS](external-dns). Because a lot of DNS settings are used by other Otomi contexts, all DNS configuration can be found [here](../for-ops/console/settings/dns).

## Configuration Values

The following values can be configured:

| Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| issuer             | Indicates the origin of the wildcard certificate. Set `custom-ca` to instruct cert-manager to derive certificate from the customRootCA. Set `letsencrypt` to instruct cert-manager to request certificate from letsencrypt endpoint. Set `byo-wildcard-cert` to provide your own wildcard certificate. |
| customRootCA       | CA that is used to create and verify self-signed certificates. Leave it empty to generate one automatically                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| customRootCAKey    | CA private key that is used to issue certificates. Leave it empty to generate one automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
