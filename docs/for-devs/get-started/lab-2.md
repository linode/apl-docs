## (Optional) Download CA

In some cases the platform is using a non-trusted CA. In this case you can download the CA and add it to your keychain.

:::info 
When Otomi is using non-trusted certificates (and is probably not configured with DNS), you will not be able to do the labs that are using Harbor.
::: 

- In the left menu of the console, click on "Download CA"

![kubecfg](../../img/ca.png)

- Double click the downloaded CA.crt or add the CA to your keychain on Mac using the following command:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Downloads/ca.crt
```

On Windows, use PowerShell (running as Administrator) with the Certutil:

```powershell
certutil.exe -addstore root <downloaded cert path>
```

Or:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath "<downloaded cert path>" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
# Restart the browser
```

But you could also run Chrome in insecure mode:

```bash
alias chrome-insecure='/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-urlfetcher-cert-requests &> /dev/null'
```
