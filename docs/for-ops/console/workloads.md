All known Workloads on the platform are listed here. Workloads can be sorted based on:

| Property      | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name | The name of the workload                               |
| Argocd | Link to the Argo CD application in the Argo CD UI               |
| Team Name     | The name of the Team responsible for the workload      |

A platform admin can also create Workloads. Make sure to select the correct context (team-name) in the top bar. See [here](/docs/for-devs/console/workloads) for more information about creating builds.
