## What is Akamai App Platform

Akamai App Platform is a platform that combines developer-centric and operations-centric tooling along with automation and a self-service dashboard. This streamlines the application life cycle when using Kubernetes, from development to delivery to the management of containerized application workloads.

The platform connects many of the technologies found in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape in a way that provides direct value. This avoids the need to reinvent the wheel each time you build, deploy, or maintain your own Kubernetes-based platform or stack.

App Platform is optimized to run on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE), but it can also be manually installed on any other [conformant Kubernetes cluster](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/).

The platform includes:

- An **integrated and pre-configured Stack of open source Kubernetes projects** to support all the essential capabilities for running cloud native applications in production on Kubernetes.

- An easy **self-service portal** for Developers to build images, create workloads, create secrets and publicly expose services

- A **Catalog** with pre-build golden path templates that can be customized.

- Kubernetes **Operators and GitOps** to manage the state of the platform based on configuration-as-code.

## The Akamai Application Platform helps

- Speed up time to market by automating and simplifying building and running applications on Kubernetes, reducing the complexity for Development teams.

- Reduce toil and avoid technical debt by providing a pre-configured and integrated suite of tools for CI/CD, Observability and Security out-of-the-box, accelerating the application delivery and enhancing security.

- Support multi-tenancy by allowing multiple teams or projects to share the same cluster, with self-service features that enable faster, independent deployments by developers.

- Self-Serving Developers to allow Developers to Build, Deploy, Expose, Observe and Secure containerized applications on Kubernetes using a web based self-service portal


### The Akamai Application Platform supports Developers with easy self-service
