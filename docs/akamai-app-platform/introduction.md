## Akamai App Platform

Akamai App Platform is a platform that combines developer-centric and operations-centric tooling along with automation and a self-service dashboard. This streamlines the application life cycle when using Kubernetes, from development to delivery to the management of containerized application workloads.

The platform connects many of the technologies found in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape in a way that provides direct value. This avoids the need to reinvent the wheel each time you build, deploy, or maintain your own Kubernetes-based platform or stack.

App Platform is optimized to run on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE), but it can also be manually installed on any other [conformant Kubernetes cluster](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/).
