Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even inside a public repository.

## Overview

[Bitnami Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) is a controller that allows you to encrypt your kubernetes secrets and store them in a secure manner, even in public repositories. The controller works by encrypting your secret into a SealedSecret, which can only be decrypted by the sealed secrets controller in your cluster.

## Bring your own certificates

You can use your certificates for the disaster recovery purpose. Please make sure to download encryption keys.

While the controller generates its own certificates upon deployment, you also have the option to bring your own certificates. This allows the controller to consume certificates from a secret labeled with `sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key=active`. The Secret should reside in the `sealed-secrets` namespace, which must be the same as the controller's namespace. You can have multiple secrets with this label.

To configure the certificates, add the following to the `values.yaml` when installing Otomi:

```yaml
apps:
  sealed-secrets:
    enabled: true
bootstrap:
  apiVersion: v1
  items:
    - apiVersion: v1
      data:
        tls.crt: <tls-crt>
        tls.key: <tls-key>
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        generateName: sealed-secrets-key
        labels:
          sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key: active
        name: <sealed-secrets-name>
        namespace: sealed-secrets
      type: kubernetes.io/tls
  kind: List
```

Make sure to replace `<tls-crt>`, `<tls-key>`, `<sealed-secrets-name>` with your actual certificate data and sealed secrets name.
