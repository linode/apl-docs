The Catalog is a library of curated Helm charts to create Kubernetes resources. By default the Catalog contains a set of Helm charts provided by Otomi to get started quickly, but they can also be modified depending on your requirements or be removed from the Catalog. 

The contents of the Catalog and the RBAC configuration (which Team can use which Helm chart) are managed by the platform administrator. Contact the platform administrator if you would like to add your own charts to use within your Team.
