In order to make a system observable, it must be instrumented. Language specific implementation of OpenTelemetry provides a way to instrument your application without touching your source code. In this lab we're going to instrument a Java application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following Apps are enabled: 

- `Tempo` on Platform
- `Otel` on Platform
- `Loki` on Platform
- `Grafana` for the Team

Enable tracing for `Istio` and `ingress-nginx-platform`:

1. Go to `Apps`.

2. Click on `Istio`.

3. Click on the configuration icon.

4. Click on the `Values` tab.

5. In the values click `Edit` and set the following values:

```yaml
tracing:
  enabled: true
  samplingRatio: "100"
```

:::note
Setting the `samplingRatio` to `100` is only done for this lab to make sure all traces are sampled. In a production environment the ratio would normally be set to `0.01`.
:::

6. Click `Submit`.

7. Repeat step 2 to 6 for the `ingress-nginx-platform` app.

## Build an image from source code

For this lab we're going to use the [Spring PetClinic Sample Application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic). Follow these steps to build an image from source code:

:::note
Using a Gitea repository is not required. You can also build using public repositories.
:::

### Create the code repository

1. Create a new repo called `petclinic` in the `team-labs` Gitea organization.

2. Clone the Spring PetClinic Sample Application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
```

3. Mirror the Spring PetClinic Sample Application to the `petclinc` repo:

```
git push --mirror https://gitea.<your-domain>/<team-name>/petclinic.git
```

### Add the code repository

1. In the left menu in the Console, click on `Code Repositories`.

2. Click on `ADD CODE REPOSITORY`.

3. Provide a name for this code repository. The name will be used to identify the code repository in App Platform. You can only use the name once within a Team. We are going to use the name `petclinic` for this code repository.

4. Select `Gitea` for the Git service (default)

5. Select `petclinic` from the `Repository` drop-down list:

6. Click `Add Code repository`

### Create the container image

1. In the left menu of the Console, click on `Container Images`.

2. Click on `CREATE CONTAINER IMAGE`.

3. Select the `BuildPacks` build task.

4. Select the `petclinic` repository from the Repository drop-down list.

5. Select the Reference `main`.

6. Optionally you can change the Image name and tag. This is the name and tag used to store the image in the private Harbor image registry.

7. Click `Create Container Image`.

## Create a workload from the developer catalog

Go to the list of Builds and add the repository of the `petclinc` build to your clipboard. Remember that the tag is latest.

1. Go to `Workloads` in the left menu and click on `Create Workload`.

2. Select `Quickstart-K8s-Deployment-Otel` from the catalog.

3. Add the Name `petclinic` for the workload.

4. Leave the `Auto image updater` to `Disabled`.

5. In the workload `values`, change the following parameters:

```yaml
image:
  repository: <paste from clipboard>
  tag: main
```

Because we're deploying a Java application here, maybe also change the resources:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 1Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 300m
    memory: 256Mi
```

6. Click `Submit`.

## Expose the service

1. In the left menu click `Services` then click on `CREATE SERVICE`.

2. Select the `petclinic` service from the `Service Name` drop-down list:

4. Click `Create Service`.

## See traces

To be able to see traces, we'll first need to generate some requests. Click on the URL of the `petclinic` service and generate some requests.

To see traces, you'll first need to find a `TraceID` of a trace. Go to `Apps` in the left menu and then click op `Loki`. Select the label `App` and select value `petclinic`.

Click on a log entry of a request. Note that the requests are logged by the Istio Envoy proxy. You will now see a link to the full trace in Grafana Tempo. Click on it.

:::note
If you don't see any traces, then check and see if the pod runs the `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/autoinstrumentation-java:1.26.0` container. Sometimes the pod starts before the `Instrumentation` resource has been created. If this is the case, restart the Pod.
