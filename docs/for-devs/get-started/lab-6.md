:::info
Harbor needs to be activated for this lab.
:::

When your team is using Harbor for private image registries, you can build images from source using pre-configured Tekton pipelines using the [paketo](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack/) task or the [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) task to build images from application source.

## Build the blue image

1. In the left menu, click on `Builds`
2. Click on `Create Build`
3. Fill in the name `blue` for your build and a tag (default tag is latest)
4. Choose `Docker` and fill in the repo URL for the `blue` repo created in the previous lab
5. Click `Submit`

Otomi will now create a Tekton Pipeline and PipelineRun resource to build the image. This will take around 15-20 seconds. Then the PipelineRun will start building the image. During this time the status will show `in progress`:

![build status](../../img/build-status.png)

When the build is finished, the status will show `healthy`:

![build status](../../img/build-status-1.png)

To see the full PipelineRun of the build, go to the list of Builds and click on `PipelineRun` of the `blue` build. This will open the Tekton Dashboard and show the status of the PipelineRun of the build:

![build status](../../img/build-status-2.png)

When the build is ready you can see the image in Harbor:

1. Open Harbor
2. Click on the project of your team. Here you will see all the registries of the team, including the registry of the new build image

## Re-run the build (optional)

To run the build again using Otomi Console, follow these steps:

1. Change the tag of the build for example to `v1.0.0`
2. Submit changes

To re-build the image using the same tag, restart the build pipeline using the Tekton cli in the Shell:

1. Start a shell in Otomi Console

2. Get the name of the pipeline

```bash
kubectl get pipelines
NAME                         AGE
docker-build-blue            41h
```

3. Get the name of the pipelinerun:

```bash
kubectl get pipelineruns
NAME                       SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
docker-build-blue-latest   True        Succeeded   41h         41h
```

4. Start the pipeline using the pipelinerun:

```bash
tkn pipeline start docker-build-blue --use-pipelinerun docker-build-blue-latest
PipelineRun started: docker-build-blue-latest-j5mmt
```

5. In order to track the PipelineRun progress run:

```bash
tkn pipelinerun logs docker-build-blue-latest-j5mmt -f
```

But it's easier to just open the Tekton dashboard and Click on `PipelineRuns`.
