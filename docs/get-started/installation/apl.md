## Comming soon!

Soon you'll be able to provision a LKE cluster combined with the Application Platform. This will have the following advantages compared to installing the Application for LKE manually:

- The Application Platform will be automatically installed on LKE

- Each LKE cluster with the Application Platform is automatically configured to use Akamai Edge DNS (for FREE!)

- If approved by the user, all the required Buckets in Object Storage will be created
