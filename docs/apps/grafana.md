## Introduction

Otomi uses Grafana to visualize [Prometheus](prometheus) metrics and [Loki](loki) logs. Team members are automatically given `Editor` role, while admins are also given `Admin` role.

It is possible to make configuration changes directly in Grafana, but only to non-conflicting settings. Data sources are preconfigured and must not be edited as changes will be gone when Grafana is redeployed.
