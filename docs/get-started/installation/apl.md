## Comming soon!

Soon you'll be able to provision a LKE cluster combined with APL. This will have the following advantages compared to installing APL manually:

- APL will be automatically installed on LKE

- Each LKE cluster with APL will get it's own Akamai Edge DNS Zone (for FREE!)

- APL will create (if approved by the user) all the required Buckets in Linode Object Storage
