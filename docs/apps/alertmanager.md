## Introduction

Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, Slack, MS Teams, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

## Configuration

Alertmanager is configured to use the global values found under settings' [alerts](../for-ops/console/settings/alerts) and [co-monitoring](../for-ops/console/settings/co-monitoring).

A team may decide to override some or all of them, in order to have alerts sent to their own endpoints. Self-service rights to alerting must be enabled for that team (enabled by default for all teams).

When running Otomi in multi-tenant mode, each team is provided a dedicated alertmanger instance.

## Automation
