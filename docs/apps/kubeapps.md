Kubeapps is a web-based UI for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes clusters. Kubeapps allows you to:

- Browse and deploy Helm charts from chart repositories
- Inspect, upgrade and delete Helm-based applications installed in the cluster
- Add custom and private chart repositories
- Browse and deploy Kubernetes Operators

Kubeapps is not yet user- and tenant aware. Teams can login to Kubeapps using the generated token that is provided when downloading the KUBECFG (through Otomi Console).

Take notice: Most of the public charts do not comply with the Otomi security policy baseline.
