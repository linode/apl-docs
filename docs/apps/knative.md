## About

Knative can be activated to deliver Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) functionality with scale-to-zero possibility. It can be compared to Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) but is container oriented, and takes only one manifest to configure an autoscaling service based on a container image of choice. Istio Virtual Services are used to route traffic for a public domain to its backing Knative Service.
