## Introduction

Loki aggregates all the container logs from the platform and stores them in a storage endpoint of choice (defaults to PVC). When Otomi is installed in multi-tenancy mode (see [here](../for-ops/console/settings/otomi) it will split logs from team namespaces and make them available only to team members.

## Configuration

Otomi provides shortcuts to selections of logs based on interest.

## Automation

When running Otomi is multi tenant mode, Otomi splits logs per team, installs a dedicated Grafana instance per team and configures authentication.
