## Introduction

Gitea is a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go. Because Otomi uses Drone to deploy changes to the values repo, it needs a git hosting solution. When no source control is configured, Otomi will deploy Gitea for Drone to target as a git repo.

Gitea may be used for other purposes, and is especially useful in combination with Drone as a CI/CD solution. Just like Otomi uses it.

## Configuration

### Role based access

Currently Gitea only supports a single role in combination with OIDC. To sign in to Gitea, a user needs to be a member of the `team-admin` group. Team members by default do not have access to Gitea.

## Automation

When Argo CD is enabled, Otomi will automatically create a GitOps repository for each Team in Gitea.
