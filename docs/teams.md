![Console: new team](img/console-new-team.png)

- Teams are tenants on the platform to support Development/DevOps teams, projects or even DTAP
- A team will get access to Otomi Console, providing access to all the tools needed for complete observability
- Teams can choose to receive alerts in Microsoft Teams, Slack or email and each team will get access to a project in Harbor and a space in Vault

## Creating Teams

- Login with a user who is a member of the otomi-admin or team-admin role
- Provide a name for the team (lowercase). The teamname can not be changed afterwards! Creating a team will result in the creation of namespace `team-$NAME`
- Provide a OIDC group name/id granting for granting access to team. Only members of the group will get access to the team
- In order to receive alerts, please choose an alerting endpoint:

- Add Resource Quotas

When required, add resource quota for the team. The resource quota should adhere to the "spec.hard" format as described [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/).

:::note Notes

There is no validation as there is no schema published. Add/change resource quota at your own risk.
