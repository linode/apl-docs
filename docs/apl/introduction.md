## Application Platform for LKE

Application Platform for LKE (you will see us use the abbreviation `APL`) is a platform that combines developer and operations-centric tools, automation and self-service to streamline the application lifecycle when using Kubernetes. From development to delivery to management of containerized application workloads.

Application Platform for LKE connects many of the technologies found in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape in a way to provide direct value. No more re-inventing the wheel when building and maintaining your own Kubernetes based platform or bespoke stack.

Application Platform for LKE is optimized to run on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE), but can also (manually) be installed on any other [conformant Kubernetes cluster](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/).
