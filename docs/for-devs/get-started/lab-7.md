## Prerequisites

To automatically scan images for vulnerabilities, `Automatically scan images on push` in the Team project settings in Harbor needs to be enabled by the platform administrator:

![image vulnerabilities](../../img/harbor-config.png)

## Scanning images

When your team is using Harbor for private image registries, you can use Trivy to automatically scan your images on push. When `Automatically scan images on push` is enabled by the platform administrator, you can see the results of the scans by following these steps:

- In the apps section in Otomi console, click on Harbor
- Click on your project. You will only see the projects of the Teams that you are a member of
- You will now see a list of the teams repositories
- Click on the repository that contains the artifact (image) that you would like to investigate
- In the list of artifacts, you can see a summary of the scan results

When you click on the scanned artifact, you'll see a more detailed report on all the vulnerabilities:
