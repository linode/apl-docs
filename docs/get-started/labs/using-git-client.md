## Using a Git client

Gitea only supports HTTPS for Git authentication. To connect to Git using HTTPS you'll first need to add a password to your account in Gitea:

1. Sign in to Gitea using OpenID.

2. Click on your account (top right) and then click `Settings`.

3. Fill in a password in the `Account` tab.

After adding a password, you can now authenticate using your username (labs-user) and the password created in Gitea.
