:::info
For this lab, Harbor needs to be activated and the cluster needs to be configured with trusted certificates (like Let's Encrypt using production certificate).
:::

## Login to Harbor

To be able to push images to Harbor, you'll need a robot account with push permissions. Otomi offers teams with a self-service option to download the Docker config for their team's private registry in Harbor. In the left menu you will see the option `Download DOCKERCFG`. Click on it to download the credentials.

When you have downloaded the docker config then run `docker login`:

```
docker login -u 'otomi-team-<team-name>-push' -p <token> harbor.<your-domain>
```

:::note
If Docker refuses to connect with an error
`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`, go to the Otomi Console,
and click `Download CA` (if you have not done so already); then copy the
obtained file to `~/.docker/ca.crt` or restart docker desktop.
:::

- Build and tag your image

```
docker build -t harbor.<your-domain>/<team-name>/<image-name>:<tag> .
```

- Push the image to Harbor

```
docker push harbor.<your-domain>/<team-name>/<image-name>:<tag>
