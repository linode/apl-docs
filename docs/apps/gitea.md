## About

Gitea is a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go. Because APL uses Tekton to deploy changes to the values repo, it needs a git hosting solution. When no source control is configured, APL will deploy Gitea for Tekton to target as a git repo. Gitea may be used for other purposes, and is especially useful in combination with Tekton as a CI/CD solution. Just like APL uses it.
