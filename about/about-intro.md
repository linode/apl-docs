Otomi is an open source self-hosted PaaS to run on top of any Kubernetes cluster and is placed in the CNCF landscape under the [PaaS/Container Service](https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#platform--paas-container-service) section. A PaaS attempts to connect many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a way to provide direct value.
