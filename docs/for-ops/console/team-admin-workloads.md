The Workload self-service feature for the Team Admin is the same as for regular Teams, but with the following difference:

- The Workload can be used to deploy Helm charts from the Catalog in any namespace.

- If the namespace does not exist, the namespace can be automatically created.

- Istio sidecars can optionally be enabled for all Pods in the Workload.

See [here](../../for-devs/console/workloads.md) for more information about Workloads.
