## The Console

The App Platform Console is the web UI of the platform and offers access to all integrated apps and self-service tasks. The Console has a topbar showing a View and a Team selector. The View selector allows to switch between the `Platform` and the `Team` view.

## Platform View

The Platform is only visable for platform administrators and provides access to:

- [Dashboard](dashboard.md): A global overview of cluster resource utilization and cluster resource request commitments.
- [Apps](apps.md): All active and inactive apps. Activate apps clicking on the power-on button.
- [Teams](teams.md): A list of all Teams.
- [User Management](usermgnt.md): Manage Users.
- [Backups](backups.md): A list of all Backups.
- [Maintenance](maintenance.md): Maintenance actions.
- [Settings](settings/alerts.md): Specific configuration of the platform.
