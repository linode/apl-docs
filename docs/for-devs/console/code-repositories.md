## Register a code repository

1. Click `ADD CODE REPOSITORY`

2. Enter a name for the code repository. This name is used to identify the code repository in App Platform.,

3. Select the Git service

- Use `Gitea` if the code repository is hosted by the in-cluster self-hosted Git service powered by Gitea.

- Use `GitHub` if the code repository is hosted by the external GitHub Git service.

- Use `GitLab` if the code repository is hosted by the external GitLab Git service.
