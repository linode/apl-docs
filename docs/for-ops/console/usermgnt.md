## About User Management

What you need to know about the User Management feature:

- Only Platform admins can create or delete users in the platform view.
- A Platform admins can assign users the role of `platform admin`, `Team admin` or `Team member`.
- Users can be created without assigning them directly to a Team.
- Team admins can assign users the role of Team member of the Team they administer.
- Team admins can not remove themselves from Teams they administer (this can only be done by the platform admin).
- Team admins can not remove other Team admins from their teams (this can only be done by the platform admin).
- Team admins can not add Platform admins to their Teams.
- Team members are not able to see the User Management section in the menu.
- Users are stored encrypted in the `values` repository `env/secrets.users.yaml` file.
- The initial login credentials of a new User can be copied from the platform view user management page by Platform admins only.
- Usersâ€™ passwords are not stored in the values repo (except initial password).
- A password reset can only be performed by a Platform admin. Password restest need to be done in the Keycloak app using the `otomi-admin` credentials. As an alternative Platform admin can also re-create a user.
- The User management feature follows the Single Source of Truth principle by referencing the `env/secrets.users.yaml` file in the `values` repository. If a new user is created directly in Keycloak, this user will be deleted at the next commit.
- Kubernetes secrets are used to pass user data between Pods, but there is a limit for user-defined variables. The maximum size of a user-defined environment variable is 32,767 characters. This limits the amount of users that can be created to around 200.
